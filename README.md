#### Typical weak supervised segmentation problems 


| No | Supervision | Difficulty | Domain | Core issues |
| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Bounding box | middle | annotated classes | transfer learning |
| 2 | One-shot segment | middle | similar objects | one-shot learning |
| 3 | Image label | hard | annotated classes | transfer learning |
