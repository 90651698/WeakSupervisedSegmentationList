# WeakSupervisedSegmentation
This repository contains lists of state-or-art weak supervised semantic segmentation works. Papers and resources are listed below according to supervision types.
(on progress)

####Typical weak supervised segmentation problems####
| Supervision | Difficulty | Domain | Core issues |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Bounding box | middle | annotated classes | transfer learning |
| One-shot segment | middle | similar objects | one-shot learning |
| Image label | hard | annotated classes | transfer learning |
